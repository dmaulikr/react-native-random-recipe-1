# React Native Random Recipes \#1

The concept behind this small repo is that A LOT of different components are out there, in the wild, and as a React Native developer there is no easy way to see if any component may work out for your project in a **real world** scenario.

So I want to try to mess around with some components I think may be interesting, but *at the same time* create a situation closer to reality - I also need to set up some basic rules.

## Rules:
### 1: just four

### 2: a new repo each time

### 3: repetition is allowed

### 4: work based on feedback

## Today's recipe

## Feedback

Got any component you would like to get tested? Any idea how to make this better? Wanna partecipate?

Drop me a line on [@kelset](https://twitter.com/Kelset) on twitter, or a PR to this README.md for longer/more prolific ideas, discussions, feedback.
