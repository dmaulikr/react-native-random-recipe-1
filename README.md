# React Native Random Recipes \#1 üë®‚Äçüç≥

The concept behind this small repo is that A LOT of different components are out there, in the wild, and as a React Native developer there is no easy way to see if any component may work out for your project in a **real world** scenario.

So I want to try to mess around with some components I think may be interesting, but *at the same time* create a situation closer to reality - I also need to set up some basic rules.

## Rules

### 1: just four

There are way too many different components. Four seems to me like a good 'balance' between complexity, time to spend on it, and number of different things to make this test app do.

### 2: a new repo each time

Pretty easy, I will have a separate repo for each one.

### 3: repetition is allowed

I don't care if I use a component in multiple recipes, as long as something change: probably React Navigation will be a omni-presence tbh.

### 4: work based on feedback

Obviously I'd like to have the recipe decided by the community, and once I've figured out how much time each of this takes me, I may even have to consider keep on going if nobody cares (but tbh I do this mainly for myself, to try things out).

## Today's recipe üçè

Some big hitters this time:

* [Reactotron](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron)
* [Mobile Azure](https://mobile.azure.com)
* [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation)
* [Redux Offline](https://github.com/jevakallio/redux-offline)

## Feedback

Got any component you would like to get tested? Any idea how to make this better? Wanna partecipate?
